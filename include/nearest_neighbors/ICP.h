class ICP
files: ICP.h/.cpp

@brief: The class implements the Iterative Closest Point algorithm, 
its point-to-point version according to 
Besl, McKay, A method for registration of 3D shapes, PAMI, 1992.

	arg min -> sum ( R m + t - p)

with m, the model points and p, the camera points. The matrix R and the translation t 
align the point set m with p. 

Note that the class's apis are labels for camera data. 

The class keeps an instance of a CUDA-based kd-tree for knn search. 
Thus, the class does not work if CUDA capabilities are not present. 

Also, this implementation has two termination criteria. 
First, a minimum error that has to be reached. The error can be set with setMinError().
Second, a maximum number of iterations. This number can be set with setMaxIterations().

The second termination criterium is helpful when working with real-time camera data and  augmented reality. 
It may yield imperfect registration when an object is moving. But the user does not notice this. 

Usage:
	1) set the camera data using setCameraData(PointCloud& pc);
	2) register a 3D model, its poitns using compute(PointCloud& pc, Pose initial_pose, Eigen::Matrix4f& result_pose, float& rms);

ICP does not run if no points are given.

Tests:
July 23, 2019, RR: the class was tested with static stanford bunny models and worked just fine. 

Dependencies:
- ICPTransform.h/.cpp
- KNN.h/.cpp
- ICPReject.h/.cpp

- Fixed a bug that set the verbose level incorrectly. 

March 3, 2020, RR
- Added two apis to set the inlier outlier rejection criteria params.

March 16, 2020, RR
- Added a api that returns the last nearest neighbors vectors. This is a debug 
 api that allows one to understand the nn better. It is not meant for general use. 

 June 3rd, 2020, RR
 - Added an api to set the outlier rejection method. 

 June 11, 2020, RR
 - Added two variables (R, t) to keep track of the rotation and translation individually. 
 - Fixed a bug: the ICP code rotated an object around the wrong centroid. 
 - Added a function to return the overall translation and rotation. The transformation can be applied on 
	a reference object to register it with its counterpart. 

Aug 06, 2020, RR
- Incorporated the initial pose into the final pose so that the result of this class is 
  a complete pose. 
- Set default values for all parameters. 

Aug 07, 2020, RR
- Added code to check the parameters ranges. 

Mar 08, 2021, WB
- Fixed ICP Rt to return a non-transposed matrix
- Transferred most Rt calculations to the PointCloudTrans class
