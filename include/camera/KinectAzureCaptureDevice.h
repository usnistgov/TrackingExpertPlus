@class   AzureViewer

@brief  Converts the Azure Kinect 2 API to a ICaptureDevice 

This class converts a Kinect into a ICaptureDevice so it can be used with point clouds. The user does not need to know kinect API to use this class.
Also allows the user to create a recording(see AzureRecording.h to access them)

Features:
- Get depth and color images live
- Get dimensions
- Create recordings for AzureRecordings
- Change certain specs of the camera
